\title{New angles on standard force fields: a general approach for incorporating atomic-level anisotropy}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\onehalfspacing


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}

Nearly all standard force fields employ the `sum-of-spheres' approximation,
which models intermolecular interactions 
purely in terms of interatomic distances. In stark contrast to this
assumption, atoms in molecules can have significantly non-spherical shapes,
leading to interatomic interaction energies with strong orientation
dependencies.
Neglecting this `atomic-level
anisotropy' can lead to significant errors in predicting interaction energies,
and herein we propose a general and computationally-efficient model
(\mastiff) whereby atomic-level orientation dependence can be incorporated
into standard intermolecular force fields. Importantly, our \mastiff model
includes anisotropic effects, not only for long-range (multipolar)
electrostatics, but also for dispersion, exchange-repulsion, and charge
penetration. We benchmark \mastiff against various sum-of-spheres models
over a large library of intermolecular interactions, and find that \mastiff
achieves quantitative accuracy with
respect to both high-level electronic structure theory and experiment.
\mastiff is highly transferable and requires minimal additional
parameterization, and is
well suited for use in next-generation ab initio force field development.
