Classical molecular simulations have become a standard tool in
interpreting and predicting the chemistry of a wide host of systems ranging
from simple liquids to complex materials and biomolecules. Such simulations
always require, as input, a mathematical description of the
system's $3N$-dimensional potential energy surface (PES). In principle, the
PES for most chemical systems can accurately be determined 
from one of several high-level electronic structure methods;
\cite{CCSDT, some reviews on EST and AIMD}
nevertheless, these types of calculations are computationally-intractable for
studying both large systems and/or long timescales. Consequently, most
molecular simulation today is performed with the aid of force fields,
broadly defined as computationally-inexpensive, parameterized mathematical expressions that
approximate the exact PES.

Given the prevalence of force fields in molecular simulation, it becomes
necessary to inquire: how successful are these force fields in enabling accurate and/or predictive
molecular simulation? Unsurprisingly, the answer often depends on a variety of
factors, particularly the choice of functional form (that is, mathematical
expression), the parameterization method, and the nature(s) of the chemical
interactions of study. 
% TODO: Look up reviews that study force fields as a function of chemical
% interaction
(As a particularly poignant example of how functional form and parameter
choice effects the quality of the resultant force field, one need look no
further than the myriad water potentials, results of which have been
summarized in \cite{Cisneros2016a}.)

    "We shall argue that there is
    theoretical and experimental evidence to show that the molecular
    anisotropy cannot be represented adequately in terms of this sort
    of superposition of spherical atoms, and we shall show how to
    introduce anisotropy directly into the site-site interaction itself,
    using the same orientation-dependent functions that are required
    to describe the long-range forces."

Goal: add anisotropy (higher-order moments) to improve description of both the
long-range and overlap regions.

Split into two categories: long-range (1/R)^n distance dependence, and
short-range (where overlap effects matter, and which decay exponentially)

What does our work add that previous work hasn't accomplished?
-- Add anisotropy to an 'ideal' (well, at least better than previous work)
isotropic potential
-- Address the general applicability of anisotropy for a diverse test set
-- Concretely address the transferability question
-- Provide an overall workflow for significantly improved anisotropic
potentials
