\begin{section}{Dimer-Based Parameterization}

After obtaining monomer parameters for a given system of interest, the final
remaining task is to fit the remaining force field parameters to reproduce the
\dftsapt calculations performed earlier in this section. Dimer-based
parameterization is carried out by the \pointer program, which will be the
subject of the next chapter. Still, the Workflow is useful for preparing input
files for this dimer-based parameterization:
%
\begin{lstlisting}
./scripts/workup_sapt_energies.py
./scripts/gather_pointer_input_files.py
\end{lstlisting}
%
The output of these scripts will generate an output .sapt file (with atomtype
descriptions taken from each \verb|input/<monomer>.atomtypes| file and a new
directory, \verb|ff_fitting|, which sets up all of the input files and monomer
parameters needed to easily run the \pointer fitting code.
