\label{sec:lmoeda-future_work}

Practical issues
-- don't use GAMESS
-- need more memory

Theoretical issues:
-- Functional form was bad
-- Hard to choose an appropriate cluster model

Fixes:
-- try second-generation ALMO-EDA?
-- try \sapt correction scheme?
-- for this system, maybe s2 approximation for the induction energy is to
blame
