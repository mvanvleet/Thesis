\begin{section}{Conclusions}
\label{sec:lmoeda-conclusions}

In this unpublished work, we have determined a new methodology for fitting
force fields to \cus-\mofs. While largely following our previous methodology
for \mof force field development, we have shown how an \lmoeda \acrlong{eda}
can be used in leiu of \sapt to generate accurate ab initio benchmark energies
in cases where \sapt itself is inaccurate. Using this new methodology, we have
successfully modeled \co interactions in \mgmof, and have simulated the
adsorption isotherm for \co in \mgmof with good accuracy compared to
experiment.

Ultimately, the methods presented herein suffered from a number of practical
and fundamental issues (see \cref{sec:lmoeda-future_work}. Unless these
limitations can be fully addressed, we do not anticipate that the \lmoeda
method can be broadly used to develop force fields for \cus-\mofs or other
large systems where \sapt is in error.
