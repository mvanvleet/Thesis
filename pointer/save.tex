What is \pointer


tricky (i.e. not-yet-standardized) aspects of parameterization
    ccsdt correction
    electrostatics
        electrostatic damping (discuss how to change sapt file!)
        off-site point charges
    polarization damping - how to choose?
    exponents - when to fit vs. hold fixed?
    dispersion - when and how to fit (ccsdt correction vs sapt, how to choose
        asymptotic correction factor, caution in fitting)
