As discussed above, some of the force field parameters that define the
two-body force field also contribute to the many-body energy. Polarization in
particular is inherently many-body, and (when possible) trimer energies should
be computed to ensure that the polarization model defined in
\cref{sec:pointer-induction} leads to good three-body energies.

For less polar systems, three-body dispersion and exchange can also be
important to include, and \citeauthor{McDaniel2014} has shown how these
parameters can be directly calculated and modeled simply in the many-body
portion of the force field.\cite{McDaniel2014} This model follows the
well-known Axilrod--Teller--Muto triple dipole functional form, and
\citen{McDaniel2014} describes how to obtain the necessary parameters.
