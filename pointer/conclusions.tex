Throughout the past two Chapters, we have outlined a force field fitting
development methodology which enables an increasingly systematic
parameterization of intermolecular force fields.
By fitting these force field on a component-by-component basis, 
minimizing parameterization via frequent recourse to 
monomer properties calculations, and ensuring the physicality of the various
functional forms that get used in the final force field,
we now can reliably generate accurate and
transferable force field parameters for a broad class of materials and
molecular systems. Though invariably much work remains to be done in this
field, it is hoped that the principles and practices outlined in this Chapter
will sufficiently guide new force field developers in extending the
applications of the \mastiff methodology (or really, any \eda-based force
fields) to tackle new and interesting problems in molecular simulation.
