\begin{section}{The Importance of Molecular Simulation}
This ref\cite{stone2013theory} is super cool!

What is molecular simulation?
What types of problems can it solve?
How does molecular simulation work? (Be sure to include solving Newton's EQs
of motion and relevant details on the partition function and interaction
energies!)
